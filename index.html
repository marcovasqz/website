                  <p class="mb-4">
                    As a bilingual engineer, I am extremely curious and always eager to learn about new technologies and skills. During the pandemic I made the decision to change my profession and pursue a career in IT, which has always been a big passion of mine. I have gained experience in configuring, troubleshooting, monitoring, and maintaining IT infrastructure, and have been involved in a large-scale Software Development project with Charter communications, where I worked in an Agile environment and gained knowledge of CI/CD workflows and basic Python scripting skills. I am also experienced with Linux, Windows, and MacOS systems and proficient in using various tools such as Wireshark, nmap, iperf, tcpdump, netstat, and Putty.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">I am a self-starter and a problem solver with a passion for computers. Originally from Venezuela, I graduated as an Industrial Engineer but decided to pursue a career in IT during the pandemic. I began my IT journey as an IT technician in Black Hawk, where I gained almost 2 years of experience in help desk support and incident response, and quickly earned a promotion to tier 2 IT technician. During this time, I obtained my CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications to enhance my knowledge and skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Seeking to learn more about networking, I was fortunate enough to be recruited as a Network DevTest Engineer, where I have been for over a year. This role has allowed me to gain a deep understanding of network protocols and tools, which has been instrumental in identifying and resolving issues quickly. Additionally, I gained valuable experience working with Linux systems and have completed the Red Hat System Administration I (RH124) course to further my expertise.
               </p>
               <p> In addition, I have been studying Python and have developed basic scripting skills, which I have used to automate repetitive tasks, saving valuable time for my team. I also obtained my Security + certification in mid 2022. My team count doubled after I joined, and I was given lead responsibilities, managing and supporting a team of engineers to achieve project goals, reporting daily to management to ensure progress and success. I also conducted training sessions for team members on network basics, software development, firmware testing, and advanced topics such as Map-T translation, CDRouter automation, and DHCP standalone server.. I quickly became the go-to of my teammates when encountering difficulties and more responsibilities have come to me organically.
              </p>
              <p>I have always been praised by my employers for my strong work ethic and my ability to learn quickly. My passion for computers makes learning enjoyable and I have a keen eye for spotting errors. I possess sharp analytical skills and am capable of solving complex problems. Despite being a new employee, I am often assigned complicated cases, as I relish a good challenge.
